# Readme file for UserProfile.MIMSync toolset #

### Summary ###
This solution provides a set of powershell commandlets to set-up Microsoft Identity Manager sync engine with SharePoint and to kick off sync on-demand. Commandlets included in this tool should help two scenarios:
1.  Customers setting up SharePoint 2016 on-prem farm from scratch can use the tool to set-up initial mapping for default user profile properties to corresponding properties in Active Directory. 
2.  Customer upgrading from SharePoint 2010 or 2013 on-prem, where they used SharePoint's in-product sync solution for syncing data from Active Directory to user profile properties can use the tool to replicate the same mappings in a Microsoft Identity Manager based sync.

Detailed step-wise documentation is provided in the repository.
