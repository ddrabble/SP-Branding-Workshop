# Patterns and Practices - Tools #
This is an open repository for community driven SharePoint Patterns and Practices program (PnP) which links closely to the work done also in the Office 365 Patterns and Practices (http://aka.ms/OfficeDevPnP).

PnP Tools repository contains more tools, code packages and scripts for the on-premises and hybrid setup, than purely for the Office 365 operations. Using classic terminology, this could be considered more targeted for IT Pro's, Architects and administrators in on-premises deployments.

Content is split based on following thinking:
- Scripts - folder containing PowerShell scripts and automation scripts in specific folder structure
- Solutions - More comprehensive solutions and tools, which can contain code and binaries

Sub folders have been named with PnP taxonomy, so that you could easily find what's relevant for you. This is open source repository, so feedback, issues and pull requests are absolutely welcome.
